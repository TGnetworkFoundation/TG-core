# This is core code in TGnetwork.

## We have 5 Philosophy and Principles:

## 1、Core Networking Originally

Relying on the strong technical strength of the team, we decided to make the core networking part of the project strive for originality, because we want to build a new ecology, so we will do all the original and independent research and development of the underlying network protocol. And open all the underlying layers to the SDK, which is easy for developers and users around the world.

## 2、Drawing on Mature Design

Bitcoin and Ethereum have done a very good example in distributed nodes and encryption technologies. We can learn from reference and study. They have done a good job in mining and a variety of application scenarios.

## 3、General Standard Based on 5G/AI /IoT Technology

At present, we do some underlying adaptation according to the standards of 5G technology. The universal application standard for 5G uses VoNR, eMBB, mMTC and URLLC. When large-scale application of 5G technology comes in the future, TGnetwork will be able to enjoy the convenience and feedback of the ecology from the network layer.The underlying technology of artificial intelligence, Neural Networks, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning, was chosen.The mainstream protocols NB-IoT, LoRa and SigFox of the Internet of Things were selected, and the TG-IoT protocol was independently developed in combination with the three characteristics, enabling large-scale rapid verification.

## 4、Blockchain:

A New Generation of Tens of Millions of Consensus Mechanisms R-DPOS The combination of POS and DPOS of blockchain technology is adopted, and the R-DPOS consensus algorithm mechanism is introduced, which can effectively accommodate the network ecology of tens of millions of nodes.

## 5、TG Token

All value circulation in the TGnetwork ecosystem is defined by the currency “TG”, which will be benchmarked according to the amount of users and ecological ecology. TG has the practical significance of increasing value scale, global circulation payment and low cost.
