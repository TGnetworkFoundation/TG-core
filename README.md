# TG-core

TGnetwork is reconfiguring an Internet network protocol based on 5G/Blockchain/Artificial Intelligence/IoT. TGnetwork is rebuilding a new Internet ecosystem. 

All users will become co-constructors of the underlying facilities of this network protocol and participate together. At the same time, the data of the users participating in it are encrypted and no longer monopolized by giants and many companies.

TGnetwork will create a decentralized Internet infrastructure, a new network protocol based on 5G technology, artificial intelligence technology, IoT technology and blockchain technology. 

On top of this new network protocol, TGnetwork will provide a range of distributed services, such as distributed node smart home, efficient low-cost enterprise-class CDN distributed storage, home traffic services, DNS and TorVPN based on 5G technology, and intrusion detection. Test system IDS, encryption and certificate economy. 

TGnetwork Eco has already reached cooperation with many well-known domestic and foreign companies, and its underlying network protocol will provide services for global Internet users based on 5G technology facilities.

In the TGnetwork ecosystem, the TG with stable value scale is used as an ecological “currency”incentive. It is a network of nodes composed of 5G users around the world to participate in the construction of a new networking ecosystem. 

Under the TGnetwork distributed network protocol, the Internet will be more open, stable, efficient, secure and free. Users will enjoy a more equal service in this ecosystem.
